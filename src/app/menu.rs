//! The live App's half of the native macOS MENU BAR (`crate::menu` owns the
//! pure roster/routing table + the muda construction; this file is the
//! App-specific wiring — routing a fired menu item's id into the SAME
//! `App::apply` seam every keypress uses). Native macOS only
//! (`cfg(target_os = "macos")`); see `crate::menu`'s module doc for the full
//! design-law + accelerator/Quit decisions.
//!
//! **Edit menu correctness note (why routed items, not muda's predefined
//! Cut/Copy/Paste/Undo/Redo):** muda's `PredefinedMenuItem::cut/copy/paste/
//! select_all/undo/redo` work by sending AppKit selectors (`cut:`, `copy:`,
//! …) up the RESPONDER CHAIN to the key window's `firstResponder` — the
//! mechanism a standard `NSTextView` implements for free. awl's document view
//! is a raw wgpu-rendered `NSView` (via winit) that implements none of those
//! selectors, so a predefined item would validate/fire against nothing and
//! silently no-op. Routing Edit's items through the SAME id → `Action` table
//! every other menu uses instead (`Action::Undo`/`CopyRegion`/`KillRegion`/
//! `Yank`/`SelectAll`, all already fired via clipboard mirroring in
//! `App::apply` — see `actions.rs`'s module doc) is both the ONLY choice that
//! actually works against this app's view and the one consistent with the
//! module's "every item fires an existing catalog Action" law. The "free
//! correctness win" the mac-citizen brief names is satisfied a different way
//! than muda's out-of-the-box predefined items: simply having a populated
//! Edit menu (regardless of how its items dispatch) is what lets macOS offer
//! its Edit-menu-anchored text services (the Character Viewer / Emoji &
//! Symbols item, Services menu entries) at all — a structural presence
//! requirement, not a responder-chain one.
