/// caret can't disagree. `apply_core` reaches these through the renderer-agnostic
/// [`crate::actions::LayoutOracle`] trait, keeping the motion logic itself free of
/// any GPU type. Columns are CHAR columns; `goal_x` and the returned x are pixels
/// relative to TEXT_LEFT (the space `xs` lives in).
///
/// These ARE the live/headless visual-line motions (the flat default): the live
/// window borrows the GPU pipeline as the oracle, the headless `--keys` replay an

///
/// Land the caret under `goal_x` on `rows[target]` and GUARANTEE the returned
/// column actually RENDERS on that row — never on a neighbour. [`col_in_row`]'s
/// past-content default is the row's `end_col`; at a SHARED wrap boundary (a wrap
/// with NO dropped whitespace — e.g. mid-word or inside a long `|`-delimited table
/// row) `end_col` EQUALS the next row's `start_col`, and [`pick_row_index`] gives
/// that shared column to the LOWER row. So a large `goal_x` would leave the caret
/// on the SAME visual row it started from — a vertical-motion FIXED POINT ("moving
/// straight up/down gets stuck"). When the naive landing escapes to a neighbour we
/// pull it back to the last column this row itself owns, so every step lands on the
/// intended adjacent row. Boundaries with a dropped space (a 1-col gap, the common
