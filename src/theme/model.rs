// --- THEME CAPABILITIES AS DATA -------------------------------------------
//
// `RenderCaps` is the declarative capability contract every per-theme render
// BEHAVIOR routes through — the roadmap's "theme capabilities as data" head
// item. Before this round, a handful of render-side call sites branched
// directly on `Theme::is_one_bit()` (an ad hoc derived boolean) to decide
// things like "does selection draw as a translucent fill or a true inverted
// video mask" or "does the elevated card get a border". That worked while
// exactly one world (Wagtail) ever needed anything other than the default —
// but it meant a FUTURE theme wanting one of those same behaviors would have
// had to grow ANOTHER `is_one_bit()`-shaped special case rather than simply
// setting a field. `RenderCaps` names each of those render decisions as its
// own field with a plain enum/number value (TOML-ready shapes — no closures,
// no trait objects — though nothing here ships an on-disk parser; see
// `ROADMAP.md`'s "theme capabilities as data" entry). FOURTEEN of the fifteen
// worlds ship [`RenderCaps::DEFAULT`] byte-identically; Wagtail is simply DATA
// that sets every field away from its default (`worlds.rs::WAGTAIL`) — no
// world-name string comparison, no `is_one_bit()` read, anywhere in
// `src/render/**` (a structural law test, `render::tests::theme_caps_law`,
// bans both from ever reappearing there).
///
/// Whether document SELECTION paints as the ordinary translucent `selection`
/// fill, or as TRUE inverse video (`SelectionPipeline::new_invert`, an
/// `OneMinusDst` blend drawn after text) — the only mechanism that can render
/// "selected" on a world with no intermediate grey to fill with. See
/// `TextPipeline::selection_invert`'s field doc + `prepare_selection_layer`.
/// The SAME field also drives every OTHER "highlight a row/band" surface
/// that faces the identical constraint: the picker's selected-row value band
/// (`overlay_rows`/`overlay_rows_invert`, `render/chrome/overlay.rs`) and the
/// web/Linux menu bar's open-title band (`menubar_hi`/`menubar_hi_invert`,
/// `render/chrome/menubar.rs`) — a picker row or an open menu title is, in
