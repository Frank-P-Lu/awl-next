//! `card` — the ONE summoned float-card mechanism shared by awl's three summoned
//! cards: the About card (`about.rs`), the Lifetime-stats card (`lifetime.rs`),
//! and the hold-⌘ shortcut peek (`peek.rs`). Each is a THIN instance over this
//! one owner (same-behavior-same-code), so the three copies of the open-flag +
//! dismiss intercept collapse to a single source:
//!
//!  * [`CardFlag`] — the process-global OPEN boolean every card wants, with the
//!    identical open/close/read surface. `about`/`lifetime`/`peek` each own one
//!    and expose it under their own verb (`about_open`/`set_open`, …), so the
//!    MECHANISM is shared while each card's public API — and its tests — are
//!    unchanged.
//!  * [`dismiss_summoned_card`] — the any-key / any-click DISMISS intercept for
//!    the two MODAL cards (About + Lifetime stats, which OWN the next key). Both
//!    `actions::apply_core`'s top-of-function arm and the live App's mouse-press
//!    handler dismiss through this ONE door instead of a per-card check+close.
//!
//! All three render through the SAME float-card pipeline
//! (`render/chrome/hud.rs::prepare_hud`, gated on their open flags). The hold-⌘
//! peek is deliberately NOT part of [`dismiss_summoned_card`]: it is not modal —
//! it closes when the hold breaks (`peek::PeekArm`), never on a key.
