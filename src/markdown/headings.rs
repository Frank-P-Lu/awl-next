///    (a serif's stroke contrast carries hierarchy structurally); the
///    mono-display worlds lean `true` (uniform strokes need weight); see the

///  - **The level gate**: TITLE (`#`) NEVER bolds, on any world, under any
///    override — Ladder J spends pure SIZE there (1.6x) — so only SECTION
///    (`##`) and SUBHEAD (`###`+) take the world's bit. `0` (a non-heading

/// weight change, never synthetic); the capture sidecar reports the same
